Use the [`ClearColor`][bevy::ClearColor] [resource][cb::res] to choose the
default background color. This color will be used as the default for all
cameras, unless overriden.

Note that the window will be black if no cameras exist. You must spawn at
least one camera.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code/examples/clear-color.rs:main}}
```

To override the default and use a different color for a specific
camera, you can set it using the [`Camera2d`][bevy::Camera2d] or
[`Camera3d`][bevy::Camera3d] components.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code/examples/clear-color.rs:camera}}
```

All of these locations (the components on specific cameras, the global
default resource) can be mutated at runtime, and bevy will use your new color.
Changing the default color using the resource will apply the new color to all
existing cameras that do not specify a custom color, not just newly-spawned
cameras.
