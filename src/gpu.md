**NOTE:** This chapter of the book is an early *Work in Progress*!
Many links are still broken!

---

This chapter covers Bevy's rendering framework and how to work with the GPU.

Make sure you are well familiar with [Bevy's Core Programming
Framework][chapter::programming]. Everything here builds on top of it.

Here you will learn how to write custom rendering code. If you are simply
interested in using the existing graphical features provided by Bevy, check
out the chapters about [General Graphics Features][chapter::graphics],
[2D][chapter::2d], and [3D][chapter::3d].
