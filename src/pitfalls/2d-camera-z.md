# 2D objects not displaying

{{#include ../include/links.md}}

Bevy's 2D [coordinate space][cb::coords] is set up so that your background can
be at Z=0.0, and other 2D objects can be layered at positive +Z coordinates
above that.

Therefore, to see your scene, the camera needs to be placed far away, at a
large +Z coordinate, looking towards -Z.

If you are overriding the camera [transform][cb::transform] / creating your
own transform, *you need to do this!* The default transform (with Z=0.0)
will place the camera so that your sprites (at positive +Z coordinates)
would be behind the camera, and you wouldn't see them! You need to
either set a large Z coordinate, or preserve/copy the Z value from the
[`Transform`][bevy::Transform] that is generated by Bevy's builtin Bundle
constructor (`Camera2dBundle::default()`).

By default, when you create a 2D camera using Bevy's built-in Bundle
constructor, Bevy sets the camera `Transform` to have Z=999.9. This is close to
the default clipping plane (visible range of Z axis), which is set to 1000.0.
