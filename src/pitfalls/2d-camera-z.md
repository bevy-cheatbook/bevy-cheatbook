# Cannot see sprites in 2D

Bevy's 2D [coordinate space](../features/transforms.md) is set up so that
your background can be at Z=0.0, and other sprite layers can be at positive
+Z coordinates above that.

However, this means that, to see your scene, the camera needs to be placed
far away, at a large +Z coordinate, looking towards -Z.

If you are overriding the camera transform / creating your own transform, *you
need to do this!* The default transform (with Z=0.0) will place the camera so
that your sprites (at positive +Z coordinates) would be behind the camera,
and you wouldn't see them! You need to either set a large Z coordinate, or
preserve/copy the Z value from the `Transform` that is generated by Bevy's
builtin Bundle constructor (`OrthographicCameraBundle::new_2d()`).

By default, when you create a 2D camera using Bevy's built-in Bundle
constructor (`OrthographicCameraBundle::new_2d()`), Bevy sets the camera
`Transform` to have Z=999.9. This is close to the default clipping plane
(visible range of Z axis), which is set to 1000.0.
