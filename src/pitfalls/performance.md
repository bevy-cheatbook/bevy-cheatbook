# Performance

## Unoptimized debug builds

You can partially enable compiler optimizations in debug/dev mode!

You can enable higher optimizations for dependencies (incl. Bevy), but not
your own code, to keep recompilations fast!

In `Cargo.toml` or `.cargo/config.toml`:

```toml
# Enable max optimizations for dependencies, but not for our code:
[profile.dev.package."*"]
opt-level = 3
```

The above is enough to make Bevy run fast. It will only slow down clean
builds, without affecting recompilation times for your project.

If your own code does CPU-intensive work, you might want to also enable some
optimization for it. However, this might greatly affect compile times in some
projects (similar to a full release build), so it is not generally recommended.

```toml
# Enable only a small amount of optimization in debug mode
[profile.dev]
opt-level = 1
```

### Why is this necessary?

Rust without compiler optimizations is *very slow*. With Bevy in
particular, the default cargo build debug settings will lead to *awful* runtime
performance. Assets are slow to load and FPS is low.

Common symptoms:
  - Loading high-res 3D models with a lot of large textures, from GLTF
    files, can take minutes! This can trick you into thinking
    that your code is not working, because you will not see anything on
    the screen until it is ready.
  - After spawning even a few 2D sprites or 3D models, framerate may drop
    to unplayable levels.

### Why not use `--release`?

You may have heard the advice: just run with `--release`! However, this is
bad advice. Don't do it.

Release mode also disables "debug assertions": extra checks useful during
development. Many libraries also include additional stuff under that
setting. In Bevy and WGPU that includes validation for shaders and GPU API
usage. Release mode disables these checks, causing less-informative crashes,
issues with hot-reloading, or potentially buggy/invalid logic going unnoticed.

Release mode also makes incremental recompilation slow. That negates
Bevy's fast compile times, and can be very annoying while you develop.

With the advice at the top of this page, you don't need to build with
`--release`, just to test your game with adequate performance. You can use
it for *actual* release builds that you send to your users.

If you want, you can also enable LTO (Link-Time-Optimization) for the actual
release builds, to squeeze out even more performance at the cost of very
slow compile times:

```toml
[profile.release]
lto = "thin"
```
