# Fixed Timestep

Relevant official examples:
[`fixed_timestep`][example::fixed_timestep].

---

If you need something to happen at fixed time intervals (a common use case
is Physics updates), you can add the respective [systems][cb::system] to
your [app][cb::app] using Bevy's [`FixedTimestep`][bevy::FixedTimestep]
[Run Criteria][cb::runcriteria].

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code/src/basics.rs:fixed-timestep}}
```

## State

You can check the current state of the fixed timestep trackers, by accessing
the [`FixedTimesteps`][bevy::FixedTimesteps] [resource][cb::res]. This lets
you know how much time remains until the next time it triggers, or how much
it has overstepped. You need to label your fixed timesteps.

See the [official example][example::fixed_timestep], which illustrates this.

## Caveats

The major problem with Bevy's fixed timestep comes from the fact that
it is implemented using [Run Criteria][cb::runcriteria]. It cannot be
combined with other run criteria, such as [states][cb::state]. This makes
it unusable for most projects, which need to rely on states for things
like implementing the main menu / loading screen / etc. Consider using
[`iyes_loopless`][project::iyes_loopless], which does not have this problem.

Also, note that your [systems][cb::system] are still called as part of the
regular frame-update cycle, along with all of the normal systems. So, the
timing is not exact.

The [`FixedTimestep`][bevy::FixedTimestep] run criteria simply checks how much
time passed since the last time your systems were ran, and decides whether
to run them during the current frame, or not, or run them multiple times,
as needed.

### **Danger!** Lost events!

By default, Bevy's [events][cb::event] are *not reliable!* They only persist
for 2 frames, after which they are lost. If your fixed-timestep systems
receive events, beware that you may miss some events if the framerate is
higher than 2x the fixed timestep.

One way around that is to use [events with manual
clearing][cb::event-manual]. This gives you control over how long events
persist, but can also leak / waste memory if you forget to clear them.
