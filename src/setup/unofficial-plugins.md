# Community Plugins Ecosystem

There is a growing ecosystem of unofficial community-made plugins for Bevy.
They provide a lot of functionality that is not officially included with the
engine. You might greatly benefit from using some of these in your projects.

To find such plugins, you should search the [Bevy Assets][bevyassets]
page on the official Bevy website. This is the official registry of known
community-made things for Bevy. If you publish your own plugins for Bevy,
you should [contribute a link to be added to that page][project::bevyassets].

Beware that some 3rd-party plugins may use unusual licenses! Be sure to
check the license before using a plugin in your project.
