## Systems

[(back to top)](#table-of-contents) [[explain](./programming/systems.md)]

Regular Rust functions, but can only accept parameters that implement [trait `SystemParam`](TODO DOCS.RS).

The standard system parameter types provided by Bevy:

{{#include ./include/systemparams.md}}

## Entities and Components

[(back to top)](#table-of-contents) [[explain](./programming/ec.md)]

Any Rust type (`struct` or `enum`) can be used as a component.

An entity is a simple integer ID for a set of components.

Type must be unique; only one instance per type per entity can exist. Use newtypes.

See [`Commands`](#commands) for how to add components to entities and spawn entities.

Component bundles:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:bundle}}
```

## Resources

[(back to top)](#table-of-contents) [[explain](./programming/res.md)]

Any Rust type (`struct` or `enum`) can be used as a resource.

Type must be unique; only one instance per type can exist. Use newtypes.

Access from system:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:res}}
```

Add when [building the app](#app-builder-main-function):

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:res-app-builder}}
```

Manage using [`Commands`](#commands):

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:res-commands}}
```

For complex resource initialization, implement `FromWorld`:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:fromworld}}
```

## Commands

[(back to top)](#table-of-contents) [[explain](./programming/commands.md)]

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:commands}}
```

These actions are applied at the end of the stage.

## Queries

[(back to top)](#table-of-contents) [[explain](./programming/queries.md)]

Iterate all matching entities:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:query}}
```

Or, if expecting the query to match only one entity (returns `Result`):

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:query-single}}
```

To operate on a specific entity:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:query-one}}
```

Add query filters:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:query-filter}}
```

## Change Detection

[(back to top)](#table-of-contents) [[explain](./programming/change-detection.md)]

Query filters:
 - `Added<T>`: detect adding new components to existing entities
 - `Changed<T>`: detect when a component is modified

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:change-detection}}
```

Change detection is triggered by `DerefMut`. Accessing components via a mutable
query without it actually being a `&mut` access, will *not* trigger it.

Beware of [frame delay / 1-frame-lag](./pitfalls/frame-delay.md). You may want
to use [explicit system ordering](#system-order).

## Query Sets

[(back to top)](#table-of-contents) [[explain](./programming/query-sets.md)]

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:query-set}}
```

## Events

[(back to top)](#table-of-contents) [[explain](./programming/events.md)]

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:events}}
```

Events don't persist. They are stored until the end of the next frame, after
which they are lost. If your systems do not handle events every frame, you could
miss some.

Beware of [frame delay / 1-frame-lag](./pitfalls/frame-delay.md). You may want
to use [explicit system ordering](#system-order).

## Local Resources

[(back to top)](#table-of-contents) [[explain](./programming/local.md)]

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:local}}
```

The type must implement `Default` or `FromWorld`. It is automatically initialized.

## Labels

[(back to top)](#table-of-contents) [[explain](./programming/labels.md)]

Labels can be strings, or any other type that implements the relevant traits.

For example, a custom enum type:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:labels}}
```

## Plugins

[(back to top)](#table-of-contents) [[explain](./programming/plugins.md)]

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:plugin}}
```

## App Builder

[(back to top)](#table-of-contents) [[explain](./programming/app-builder.md), [stages](./programming/stages.md)]

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:app-builder}}
```

## System Order

[(back to top)](#table-of-contents) [[explain](./programming/system-order.md)]

Execution order is *nondeterministic* and may change every frame!

Use [labels](#labels) to specify order explicitly:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:system-labels}}
```

## States

[(back to top)](#table-of-contents) [[explain](./programming/states.md)]

App builder with States:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:states}}
```

Change or check States:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:res-state}}
```

## Transforms

[(back to top)](#table-of-contents) [[explain](./features/transforms.md)]

Coordinate system: +X is right, +Y is up, +Z is out of the screen. Right-handed. 3D matches 2D.

Transforms consist of: translation (coordinates), rotation, scale.

The `Transform` component is the relative/local transform. You may modify this directly.

The `GlobalTransform` component is the absolute/global transform. Do not modify; internally managed by Bevy.

## Parent/Child Hierarchy

[(back to top)](#table-of-contents) [[explain](./programming/parent-child.md)]

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:parent-child}}
```

Reparent an existing entity:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:add-parent}}
```

Transforms: Ensure both parent and child have both components: `Transform`, `GlobalTransform`.

## System Chaining

[(back to top)](#table-of-contents) [[explain](./programming/system-chaining.md)]

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:system-chaining}}
```

## Assets

[(back to top)](#table-of-contents) [[explain](./features/assets.md)]

Load asset:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:asset-load}}
```

Access assets from systems:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:asset-use}}
```

Create assets from code:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:asset-new}}
```

Asset events:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ./code/src/cheatsheet.rs:asset-event}}
```
