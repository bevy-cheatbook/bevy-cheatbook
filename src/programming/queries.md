# Queries

Queries let you access components of entities.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code/src/basics.rs:sys-simple-query}}
```

Get the components associated with a specific entity:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code/src/basics.rs:query-get}}
```

Get the IDs of the entities you access with your queries:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code/src/basics.rs:query-entity}}
```

If you know that the query should only ever match a single entity, you can use `single`/`single_mut` (returns a `Result`), instead of iterating:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code/src/basics.rs:query-single}}
```

## Bundles

Queries work with individual components. If you created an entity using a
[bundle](./ec.md#component-bundles), you need to query for the specific
components from that bundle that you care about.

A common beginner mistake is to query for the bundle type!

## Query Filters

Add query filters to narrow down the entities you get from the query.

Use `With`/`Without` to only get entities that have specific components.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code/src/basics.rs:sys-query-filter}}
```

Multiple filters can be combined:
 - in a tuple to apply all of them (AND logic)
 - using the `Or<(...)>` wrapper to detect any of them (OR logic).
   - (note the tuple inside)
