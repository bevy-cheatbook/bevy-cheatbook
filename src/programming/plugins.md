# Plugins

As your project grows, it can be useful to make it more modular. You can split it into plugins.

Plugins are simply collections of things to be added to the [App Builder](./app-builder.md).

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code/src/basics.rs:plugins}}
```

For internal organization in your own project, the main value of plugins comes
from not having to declare all your Rust types and functions as `pub`, just so
they can be accessible from `main` to be added to the app builder. Plugins let
you add things to your app from multiple different places, like separate Rust
files / modules.

You can decide how plugins fit into the architecture of your game. Some suggestions:
 - Create plugins for different [states](./states.md).
 - Create plugins for various sub-systems, like physics or input handling.

## Publishing Crates

Plugins give you a nice way to publish Bevy-based libraries for other people to
easily include into their projects.

If you intend to publish plugins as crates for public use, you should read
[the official guidelines for plugin authors](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/docs/plugins_guidelines.md).
