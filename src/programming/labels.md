# Labels

You need labels to name various things in your app, such as
[systems](./system-order.md), [run criteria](./run-criteria.md),
[stages](./stages.md), and [ambiguity sets](TODO).

Bevy uses some clever Rust type system magic, to allow you to use strings
as well as your own custom types for labels, and even mix them!

You may use a value of any type as a label, as long as it has the following
standard Rust traits: `Clone + Eq + Hash + Debug` (and the implied `+ Send +
Sync + 'static`).

You need to derive the appropriate trait: `StageLabel`, `SystemLabel`, `RunCriteriaLabel`, or `AmbiguitySetLabel`.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code/src/basics.rs:labels}}
```

For quick prototyping, it is convenient to just use strings as labels.

However, by defining your labels as custom types, the Rust compiler can check
them for you, and your IDE can auto-complete them. It is the recommended way, as
it prevents mistakes, and helps you stay organized in larger projects.
