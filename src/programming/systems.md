Systems are pieces of functionality, which are run by Bevy. They are typically
implemented using regular Rust functions.

This is how you implement all your game logic. Each system specifies what data
it needs to access to do its thing, and Bevy will run them in parallel when
possible. You can add configuration/metadata to control how your systems should
be run, using the [app builder][cb::app].

These functions can only take [special parameter types][builtins::systemparam],
to specify what [data][cb::ecs-intro-data] you need access to. If you use
unsupported parameter types in your function, [you will get confusing compiler
errors!][pitfall::intosystem]

Some of the possibilities are:
 - accessing [resources][cb::res] using [`Res`][bevy::Res]/[`ResMut`][bevy::ResMut]
 - accessing [components of entities][cb::component] using [queries][cb::query] ([`Query`][bevy::Query])
 - creating/destroying entities, components, and resources using [Commands][cb::commands] ([`Commands`][bevy::Commands])
 - sending/receiving [events][cb::event] using [`EventWriter`][bevy::EventWriter]/[`EventReader`][bevy::EventReader]

[See here for a full list!][builtins::systemparam]

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code011/src/programming/systems.rs:sys-debug-res}}
```

System parameters can be grouped into tuples (which can be nested). This is
useful for organization.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code011/src/programming/systems.rs:sys-param-tuple}}
```

{{#include ../include/builtins.md:systemparam-limits}}

There is also a different kind of systems: [exclusive systems][cb::exclusive].
They have [full direct access to the ECS World][cb::world], so you can access
any data you want and do anything, but cannot run in parallel. For most use
cases, you should use regular parallel systems.

## Runtime

To run your systems, you need to add them to Bevy via the [app builder][cb::app]:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code011/src/programming/systems.rs:systems-appbuilder}}
```

Be careful: writing a new system `fn` and forgetting to add it to your app is a
common mistake! If you run your project and your new code doesn't seem to be
running, make sure you added the system!

The above is enough for simple projects.

Systems are contained in [schedules][cb::schedule]. [`Update`][bevy::Update] is the
schedule where you typically add any systems you want to run every frame.
[`Startup`][bevy::Startup] is where you typically add systems that should run
only once on app startup. There are also [other possibilities][builtins::schedule].

As your project grows more complex, you might want to enhance your app builder
with some of the powerful tools that Bevy offers for managing when/how
your systems run, such as: [explicit ordering][cb::system-order],
[system sets][cb::systemset], [states][cb::state],
[run conditions][cb::rc].
