# Change Detection

Bevy allows you to easily detect when data is changed. You can use this to
perform actions in response to changes.

# Components

Use [query filters](./queries.md#query-filters):
 - `Added<T>`: detect new component instances
   - if the component was added to an existing entity
   - if a new entity with the component was spawned
 - `Changed<T>`: detect component instances that have been changed
   - triggers when the component is accessed mutably
   - also triggers in if the component is newly-added (as per `Added`)

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code/src/basics.rs:change-detection}}
```

`Changed` detection is triggered by `DerefMut`. Simply accessing components via a
mutable query, without actually performing a `&mut` access, will *not* trigger it.

This makes change detection quite accurate. You can rely on it to optimize
your game's performance, or to otherwise trigger things to happen.

Also note that when you mutate a component, Bevy does not track if the new value
is actually different from the old value. It will always trigger the change
detection. If you want to avoid that, simply check it yourself:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code/src/basics.rs:change-if-wrap}}
```

Change detection is reliable -- it will detect any changes that have occured
since the last time your detecting system ran. If your system only runs
sometimes (such as with [states](./states.md) or [run criteria](./run-criteria.md)),
you *do not* have to worry about missing changes.

## Possible Pitfalls

Beware of [frame delay / 1-frame-lag](../pitfalls/frame-delay.md). This can
occur if Bevy runs the detecting system before the changing system. The
detecting system will see the change the next time it runs, typically on the
next frame update.

If you need to ensure that changes are handled immediately / during the same frame,
you can use [explicit system ordering](./system-order.md).

However, when detecting component additions with `Added<T>` (which are typically
done using [`Commands`](./commands.md)), this is not enough; you need [stages](./stages.md).
