# App Builder (main function)

{{#include ../include/links.md}}

Relevant official examples: All of them ;)

In particular, check out the complete game examples:
[`alien_cake_addict`][example::alien_cake_addict],
[`breakout`][example::breakout].

To enter the bevy runtime, you need to configure an [`App`][bevy::App]. The app is how you
define the structure of all the things that make up your project: [plugins][cb::plugin],
[systems][cb::system], [event][cb::event] types, [states][cb::state], [stages][cb::stage]â€¦

Technically, the [`App`][bevy::App] contains the ECS World(s) (where all the data is stored)
and Schedule(s) (where all the [systems][cb::system] to run are stored). For advanced use-cases,
[Sub-apps][cb::subapp] are a way to have more than one ECS World and Schedule.

[Local resources][cb::local] do not need to be registered. They are part of
their respective [systems][cb::system].

[Component][cb::component] types do not need to be registered.

---

Schedules cannot (yet) be modified at runtime; all [systems][cb::system] you
want to run must be added/configured in the [`App`][bevy::App] ahead of time.

The data in the ECS World can be modified at any time; create/destroy your
[entities][cb::ec] and [resources][cb::res], from [systems][cb::system]
using [Commands][cb::commands], or [exclusive systems][cb::exclusive] using
[direct World access][cb::world].

[Resources][cb::res] can also be initialized ahead of time, here in the
[`App`][bevy::App] builder.

---

You also need to add the [plugin group][cb::plugingroup] with Bevy's built-in functionality: either
[`DefaultPlugins`][bevy::DefaultPlugins] if you are making a full game/app, or
[`MinimalPlugins`][bevy::MinimalPlugins] for something like a headless server.

Note that there are some special [configuration resources][builtins::res-config]
that must be added first, if you would like to use them, to take effect.
