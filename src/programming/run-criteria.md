# Run Criteria

Run Criteria are a mechanism for controlling if Bevy should run specific
systems, at runtime. This is how you can make functionality that only runs under
certain conditions.

Run Criteria are a lower-level primitive. Bevy provides higher-level
abstractions on top, such as [States](./states.md). You can use Run Criteria
without such abstractions, if you really need more direct control.

Run Criteria can be applied to individual [systems](./systems.md), [system sets](./system-sets.md), and [stages](./stages.md).

Run Criteria are Bevy systems that return a value of type [`enum
ShouldRun`](TODO DOCS). They can accept any system parameters, like a normal
system.

This example shows how run criteria might be used to implement different
multiplayer modes:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code/src/basics.rs:run-criteria}}
```

## Run Criteria Labels

If you have multiple systems or system sets that you want to share the same run
criteria, you can give it a [label](./labels.md).

When you use a label, Bevy will only execute the run criteria once, remember its
output, and apply it to everything with the label.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code/src/basics.rs:run-criteria-label}}
```

The run-once property is especially important if you have a complex run criteria
system that performs mutations or is otherwise non-idempotent.

Bevy's [fixed timestep](../features/fixed-timestep.md) is also implemented using
run criteria under the hood.
