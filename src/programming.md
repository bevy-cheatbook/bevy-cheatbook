# Bevy Programming Framework

This chapter presents the features of the Bevy core programming framework. This
covers the ECS (Entity Component System), App and Scheduling.

All the knowledge of this chapter is useful even if you want to use Bevy as
something other than a game engine. For example: using just the ECS for a
scientific simulation.

Hence, this chapter does not cover the game-engine parts of Bevy. Those
features are covered in other chapters of the book. You can start with
[Game Engine Fundamentals][chapter::fundamentals] chapter.

For additional of programming patterns and idioms, see the [Programming
Patterns][chapter::patterns] chapter.

If you are also interested in GPU programming, see the [Bevy GPU
Framework][chapter::gpu] chapter.
