# Bevy Programming Framework

{{#include ./include/links.md}}

This chapter presents the features of the Bevy core programming framework. This
covers the ECS (Entity Component System), App and Scheduling.

For examples of programming patterns and idioms, see the [Programming
Patterns][chapter::patterns] chapter.

All the knowledge of this chapter is useful even if you want to use Bevy as
something other than a game engine. For example: using just the ECS for a
scientific simulation.

Hence, this chapter does not cover the game-engine parts of Bevy. Those
features are covered in other chapters of the book, like the [Bevy Game
Engine Core][chapter::features] chapter.

Includes concise explanations of each core concept, with code snippets to
show how it might be used in a game. Care is taken to point out any important
considerations for using each feature and to recommend known good practices.
