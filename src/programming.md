# Bevy Programming Framework

{{#include ./include/links.md}}

This chapter presents the features of the Bevy core programming framework. This
covers the ECS (Entity Component System), App and Scheduling.

For examples of programming patterns and idioms, see the [Programming
Patterns][chapter::patterns] chapter.

All the knowledge of this chapter is useful even if you want to use Bevy as
something other than a game engine. For example: using just the ECS for a
scientific simulation.

Hence, this chapter does not cover the game-engine parts of Bevy. Those
features are covered in other chapters of the book, like the [General Game
Engine Features][chapter::features] chapter.

Includes concise explanations of each core concept, with code snippets to show
how it might be used. Care is taken to point out any important considerations
for using each feature and to recommend known good practices.
