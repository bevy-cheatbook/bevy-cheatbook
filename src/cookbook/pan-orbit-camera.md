This is a camera controller similar to the ones in 3D editors like Blender.

Use the right mouse button to rotate, middle button to pan, scroll wheel to
move inwards/outwards.

This is largely shown for illustrative purposes, as an example
to learn from. In your projects, you may want to try the
[`bevy_config_cam`][project::bevy_config_cam] plugin.
