# Render Stages

{{#include ../include/links.md}}

Everything on the CPU side (the whole process of driving the GPU workloads)
is structured in a sequence of "render stages":

{{#include ../include/builtins.md:render-stages}}

## Timings

Note: Pipelined rendering is not yet actually enabled in Bevy 0.8. This section
explains the intended behavior, which will land in a future Bevy version. You
have to understand it, because any custom rendering code you write will have to
work with it in mind.

![Diagram of pipelined rendering timings in app-bound and render-bound cases](/img/pipelined-rendering.png)

Every frame, [Extract](#extract) serves as the synchronization point.

When the Render Schedule completes, it will start again, but Extract will
wait for the App Schedule, if it has not completed yet. The App Schedule
will start again as soon as Extract has completed.

Therefore:
 - in an App-bound scenario (if app takes longer than render):
   - The start of Extract is waiting for App to finish
 - in a Render-bound scenario (if render takes longer than app):
   - The start of App is waiting for Extract to finish

If [vsync][cb::vsync] is enabled, the wait for the next refresh of the
screen will happen in the [Prepare](#prepare) stage. This has the effect of
prolonging the Prepare stage in the Render schedule. Therefore, in practice,
your game will behave like the "Render-bound" scenario shown above.

The final render (the framebuffer with the pixels to show in the
[window][cb::window]) is *presented* to the OS/driver at the end of the
[Render](#render) stage.

Bevy updates its [timing information][cb::time] (in [`Res<Time>`][bevy::Time])
at the start of the First stage in the main App schedule. The value to
use is measured at "presentation time", in the render world, and the
[`Instant`][std::Instant] is sent over a channel, to be applied on the
next frame.

## Adding Systems to Render Stages

If you are implementing custom rendering functionality in Bevy, you will likely
need to add some of your own systems to at least some of the render stages:

 - Anything that needs data from your main App World will need a system in
   [Extract](#extract) to copy that data. In practice, this is almost everything,
   unless it is fully contained on the GPU, or only uses renderer-internal
   generated data.

 - Most use cases will need to do some setup of GPU resources
   in [Prepare](#prepare) and/or [Queue](#queue).

 - In [Cleanup](#cleanup), all [entities][cb::ec] are cleared automatically.
   If you have some custom data stored in [resources][cb::res], you can let it
   stay for the next frame, or add a system to clear it, if you want.

The way Bevy is set up, you shouldn't need to do anything in [Render](#render)
or [PhaseSort](#phasesort). If your custom rendering is part of the Bevy
[render graph][cb::render::graph], it will just be handled automatically
when Bevy executes the render graph in the [Render](#render) stage. If you
are implementing custom [phase items][cb::render::phaseitem], the Main Pass
render graph node will render them together with everything else.

You can add your rendering systems to the respective stages, using the render
[sub-app][cb::subapp]:

```

## Extract

Extract is a very important and special stage. It is the synchronization
point that links the two ECS Worlds. This is where the data required for
rendering is copied ("extracted") from the main App World into the Render
World, allowing for pipelined rendering.

During the Extract stage, nothing else can run in parallel, on either the
main App World or the Render World. Hence, Extract should be kept minimal
and complete its work as quickly as possible.

It is recommended that you avoid doing any computations in Extract, if
possible. Just copy data.

It is recommended that you only copy the data you actually need for rendering.
Create new [component types][cb::component] and [resources][cb::res] just
for use within the render World, with only the data you need.

For example, Bevy's 2D sprites uses a [`struct
ExtractedSprite`][bevy::ExtractedSprite], where it copies the relevant data
from the "user-facing" components of sprite and spritesheet entities in the
main World.

Bevy **reserves Entity IDs** in the render World, matching all the Entities
existing in the main World. In most cases, you do not need to *spawn*
new entities in the render World. You can just [insert components with
Commands][cb::commands] on the same Entity IDs as from the main World.

```
// TODO: code example
```

## Prepare

Prepare is the stage to use if you need to set up any data on the
GPU. This is where you can create GPU [buffers][cb::render::buffer],
[textures][cb::render::texture], and [bind groups][cb::render::bindgroup].

// TODO: elaborate on different ways Bevy is using it internally

```
// TODO: code example
```

## Queue

Queue is the stage where you can set up the "rendering jobs" you will need to
execute.

Typically, this means creating [phase items][cb::render::phaseitem]
with the correct [render pipeline][cb::render::pipeline] and [draw
function][cb::render::drawfunction], for everything that you need to draw.

For other things, analogously, Queue is where you would set up the workloads
(like compute or draw calls) that the GPU would need to perform.

// TODO: elaborate on different ways Bevy is using it internally

```
// TODO: code example
```

## PhaseSort

This stage exists for Bevy to sort all of the [phase
items][cb::render::phaseitem] that were set up during the [Queue](#queue)
stage, before rendering in the [Render](#render) stage.

It is unlikely that you will need to add anything custom here. I'm not aware
of use cases. [Let me know][contact] if you know of any.

## Render

Render is the stage where Bevy executes the [Render Graph][cb::render::graph].

The built-in behavior is configured using Cameras. For each active Camera,
Bevy will execute its associated render graph, configured to output to its
associated render target.

If you are using any of the [standard render phases][cb::render::phase-core],
you don't need to do anything. Your custom [phase items][cb::render::phaseitem]
will be rendered automatically as part of the Main Pass built-in render graph
[nodes][cb::render::graph-node], alongside everything else.

If you are implementing a rendering feature that needs a separate step, you
can add it as a [render graph node][cb::render::graph-node], and it will be
rendered automatically.

The only time you might need to do something custom here is if you really
want to sidestep Bevy's frameworks and reach for low-level `wgpu` access.
You could place it in the Render stage.

## Cleanup

Bevy has a built-in system in Cleanup that clears all [entities][cb::ec] in
the render World. Therefore, all data stored in components will be lost.
It is expected that fresh data will be obtained in the next frame's
[Extract](#extract) stage.

To persist rendering data over multiple frames, you should store it in
[resources][cb::res]. That way you have control over it.

If you need to clear some data from your resources sometimes, you could
add a custom system to the Cleanup stage to do it.
