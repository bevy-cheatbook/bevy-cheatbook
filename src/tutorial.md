# New to Bevy? Guided Tutorial!

{{#include ./include/links.md}}

Welcome to Bevy! :) We are glad to have you in our community!

Make sure to also look at [the official Bevy examples][bevy::examples]. If
you need help, use [GitHub Discussions][bevy::ghdiscussions], or feel welcome
to join us to chat and ask for help in [Discord][bevy::discord].

This page is intended for new learners. It will guide you through this book in
an order that makes sense for learning: from the basics, towards more advanced
topics. This is unlike the main table-of-contents (the left sidebar), which
was designed to be a reference for Bevy users of any skill level.

This tutorial page does not list/link every page in the book. It is a guide
to help you gain comprehensive general knowledge. The book also has many
pages dedicated to solutions for specific problems; those are not listed here.

Feel free to jump around the book and read whatever interests you.

You will be making something cool with Bevy in no time! ;)

If you run into issues, be sure to check the
[Common Pitfalls][chapter::pitfalls] chapter, to see if this book has something
to help you. Solutions to some of the most common issues that Bevy community
members have encountered are documented there.

## Basics

These are the absolute essentials of using Bevy â€“ the minimum concepts to
get you started. Every Bevy project, even a simple one, would require you
to be familiar with these concepts.

You could conceivably make something like a simple game-jam game or prototype,
using just this knowledge. Though, as your project grows, you will likely
quickly need to learn more.

## Next Steps

You will likely need to learn about at least some of these topics to make
a non-trivial Bevy project. After you are confident with the basics, you
can familiarize yourself with these, to become a proficient Bevy user.
