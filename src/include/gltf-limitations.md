Bevy does not fully support all features of the GLTF format and has some
specific requirements about the data. Not all GLTF files can be loaded and
rendered in Bevy. Unfortunately, in many of these cases, you will not get
any error or diagnostic message.

Commonly-encountered limitations:

  - Textures embedded in ascii (`*.gltf`) files (base64 encoding) cannot be loaded.
    Put your textures in external files, or use the binary (`*.glb`) format.
  - Mipmaps are only supported if the texture files (in KTX2 or DDS format) contain them.
    The GLTF spec requires missing mipmap data to be generated by the game engine, but Bevy
    does not support this yet. If your assets are missing mipmaps, textures will look grainy/noisy.

This list is not exhaustive. There may be other unsupported scenarios that I
did not know of or forgot to include here. :)
