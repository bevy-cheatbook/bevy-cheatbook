# Project Setup (Cargo Make)

Make sure to first read the [overview page](../wasm.md). It contains important
general information.

Cargo Make is a `cargo` extension that allows defining custom tasks to
automate whatever you need. Compared to the [`wasm-pack`](./wasm-pack.md)
approach, it is more automated and convenient for development, but requires
more complicated configuration.

This page will show you how to set up a project that supports these features:
  - Can be built for both Web and Desktop (Linux/Mac/Windows).
  - Can easily run either version with a single command.
    - For the web version, it runs a local server and opens in your browser.

To do this easily, we will use [bevy_webgl2_app_template][template_link].
Remember that Cargo Make is a flexible tool, and templates are opinionated. You
could write your own configuration, but that is outside the scope of this guide.

The only reason why this page is so short, is because we rely on the template
to give us the complicated configuration that Cargo Make requires.

## Prerequisites

You need to have support for the WASM target for the Rust compiler. If you are
using `rustup` to manage your Rust installation, you can install it like this:

```shell
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

You also need to install `cargo-make`. You can do that using `cargo`:

```shell
cargo install cargo-make
```

## Supporting Files

Copy `Makefile.toml` and `index.html` from
[bevy_webgl2_app_template][template_link] into your project.

## Cargo

In your `Cargo.toml`, we must configure the features and dependencies,
in the way that is expected by the template:

```toml
[features]
default = [
  "bevy/bevy_gltf",
  "bevy/bevy_winit",
  "bevy/render",
  "bevy/png",
]

native = [
  "bevy/bevy_wgpu",
]

web = [
  "bevy_webgl2"
]

[dependencies]
bevy = {version="0.5.0", default-features=false}
bevy_webgl2 = {version="0.5.0", optional=true}
```

## Main Source File

In `src/main.rs`, write your main function as follows:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let mut app = App::build();
    
    app.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins);

    // when building for Web, use WebGL2 rendering
    #[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]
    app.add_plugin(bevy_webgl2::WebGL2Plugin);
    
    // TODO: add all your other stuff to `app` as usual

    app.run();
}
```

## Building and Running

To run the web version of your game, you can just run:

```shell
cargo make serve
```

It will start a web server on `localhost:4000` and open the game in your browser.

To run the native desktop version of your game:

```shell
cargo make run
```

To simply build the game:

```shell
cargo make --profile release build-web
cargo make --profile release build-native
```

## Deploying

To publish your game, you need to create a website. As the bare minimum,
you can create a simple HTML file (call it `index.html`) containing:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>My Bevy Project</title>
</head>
<body>
<script type="module">
  import init from "./wasm.js";
  init();
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

The above HTML is just enough to display your game. You can enhance and
extend it as much as you want, to make a fancy website.

Upload the following files in the same directory tree as they're generated
in, to your web server:

```
|_ target
|  |_ wasm32-unknown-unknown
|  |  |_release
|  |    |_ myproject.d
|  |    |_ myproject.wasm
|  |_ wasm.js
|  |_ wasm_bg.wasm
|_ index.html
```
