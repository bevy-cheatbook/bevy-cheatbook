# Access the Asset Data

{{#include ../include/links.md}}

To access the actual asset data from systems, use the
[`Assets<T>`][bevy::Assets] [resource][cb::res].

You can identify your desired asset using either the [handle][cb::handle]
([untyped handles][cb::handleuntyped] can also be used) or the [asset
path][cb::assetpath]:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code/src/basics.rs:asset-access}}
```

## Creating Assets from Code

You can also add assets to [`Assets<T>`][bevy::Assets] manually.

Sometimes you need to create assets from code, rather than [loading them
from files][cb::assetserver]. Some common examples of such use-cases are:
  - creating texture atlases
  - creating 3D or 2D materials
  - procedurally-generating assets like images or 3D meshes

To do this, first create the data for the asset (an instance of the
[asset type][builtins::asset]), and then add it `.add(â€¦)` it to the
[`Assets<T>`][bevy::Assets] resource, for it to be stored and tracked by
Bevy. You will get a [handle][cb::handle] to use to refer to it, just like
any other asset.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code/src/basics.rs:asset-add}}
```
