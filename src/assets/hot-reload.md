# Hot-Reloading Assets

{{#include ../include/links.md}}

Relevant official examples:
[`hot_asset_reloading`][example::hot_asset_reloading].

---

At runtime, if you modify the file of an [asset][cb::assets] that is loaded
into the game (via the [`AssetServer`][bevy::AssetServer]), Bevy can detect
that and reload the asset automatically. This is very useful for quick
iteration. You can edit your assets while the game is running and see the
changes instantly in-game.

Not all [file formats][builtins::file-formats] and use cases are supported
equally well. Typical asset types like textures / images should work without
issues, but complex GLTF or scene files, or assets involving custom logic,
might not.

If you need to run custom logic as part of your hot-reloading
workflow, you could implement it in a [system][cb::system], using
[`AssetEvent`][bevy::AssetEvent] ([learn more][cb::assetevent]).

Hot reloading is opt-in and has to be enabled in order to work. You can do
this in a [startup system][cb::app]:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code/src/basics.rs:asset-watch}}
```

Note that this requires the `filesystem_watcher` [Bevy cargo
feature][cb::features]. It is enabled by default, but if you have disabled
default features to customize Bevy, be sure to include it if you need it.

## Shaders

Bevy also supports hot-reloading for shaders. You can edit your
custom shader code and see the changes immediately.

This only works if you are loading your shaders through the bevy asset
system (via the [`AssetServer`][bevy::AssetServer]).

Shader code that does not come from asset files, such as if you include
it as a static string in your source code, cannot be hot-reloaded.
