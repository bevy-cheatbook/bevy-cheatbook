# Unofficial Bevy Cheat Book

Concise practical reference to the [Bevy game engine](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy).

Covers useful syntax, features, programming patterns, and solutions ("recipes") for common game development tasks.

Designed to be easy to read, straight to the point, using simple language to focus on the important information.

It is not a tutorial or guide, and not intended to be read in order. Jump to whatever is useful to you!

The book is not exhaustive / complete. It is my best attempt to cover the most practically-relevant aspects.

The book has several sections:

 - [Bevy Cheatsheet](./cheatsheet/_index.md): condensed one-page summary of common bevy syntax and features
 - [Bevy Basics](./basics/_index.md): overview of the basics of programming in Bevy
 - [Common Pitfalls](./pitfalls/_index.md): common issues to watch out for
 - [Advanced Patterns](./patterns/_index.md): good practices for using bevy effectively
 - [Bevy Cookbook](./cookbook/_index.md): examples covering common game development problems

***Welcome! Hope this book serves you well!***
