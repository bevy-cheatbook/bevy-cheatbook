# Unofficial Bevy Cheat Book

Concise practical reference to the [Bevy game engine](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy).

Covers useful syntax, features, programming patterns, and solutions for common game development tasks.

Designed to be easy to read, straight to the point, using simple language to focus on the important information.

While rich in content, this book does not aim to be exhaustive or complete. It
cannot feasibly cover every feature of bevy. It is my best attempt to teach the
most practically-relevant aspects.

The book has several sections:

 - [Bevy Cheatsheet](./cheatsheet/_index.md): condensed one-page listing of common Bevy syntax and features
 - [Bevy Programming](./programming/_index.md): overview of programming in Bevy
 - [Bevy Features](./features/_index.md): usage notes about some common Bevy features
 - [Common Pitfalls](./pitfalls/_index.md): common issues or surprises to watch out for
 - [Advanced Patterns](./patterns/_index.md): non-obvious tricks or techniques; may be controversial
 - [Bevy Cookbook](./cookbook/_index.md): examples covering common practical use cases

Not intended to be read in order. Jump to whatever is useful to you!

## Stability Warning

Bevy is still a very new and experimental game engine! It has only been public
for less than a year!

While improvements have been happening at an incredible pace, and development is
active, Bevy simply hasn't yet had the time to mature.

*There are no stability guarantees and breaking changes happen often!*

Usually, it not hard to adapt to changes with new releases (or even track the
main git development branch), but you have been warned!

## Maintenance

This version of the book is for Bevy release 0.5.

You may also access [the `next` branch](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/next/).
It contains any WIP efforts to cover newer developments in Bevy's main git
branch, in preparation for the next release.

I intend to keep this book up-to-date and relevant with every new Bevy release.
I also try to regularly make general improvements to it, when I can manage it.
