# Unofficial Bevy Cheat Book

{{#include ./include/links.md}}

This is a reference-style book for the [Bevy game engine][bevy::website]
([GitHub][project::bevy]).

It aims to teach Bevy concepts in a concise way, help you be productive,
and discover the knowledge you need.

This book aggregates a lot of community wisdom that is often not covered
by official documentation, saving you the need to struggle with issues that
others have figured out already!

While it aims to be exhaustive, documenting an entire game engine is
a monumental task. I focus my time on whatever I believe the community
needs most.

Therefore, there are still a lot of omissions, both for basics and advanced
topics. Nevertheless, I am confident this book will prove to be a valuable
resource to you!

***Welcome! May this book serve you well!***

## Stability Warning

Bevy is still a very new and experimental game engine! It has only been
public since August 2020!

While improvements have been happening at an incredible pace, and development
is active, Bevy simply hasn't yet had the time to mature.

*There are no stability guarantees and breaking changes happen often!*

Usually, it not hard to adapt to changes with new releases (or even track
the main git development branch), but you have been warned!
