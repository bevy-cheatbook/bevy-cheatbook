# Unofficial Bevy Cheat Book

Concise practical reference to the
[Bevy game engine](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy).

Covers useful syntax, features, programming patterns, and solutions for
common game development tasks.

Designed to be easy to read, straight to the point, using simple language
to focus on the important information.

While rich in content, this book does not aim to be exhaustive or complete. It
cannot feasibly cover every feature of bevy. It is my best attempt to teach
the most practically-relevant aspects.

The book has several sections:

  - [Quick Reference](./cheatsheet.md):
    alphabetical listing of various Bevy and game dev jargon and concepts,
    with quick definitions and links to relevant pages in the book
  - [Bevy Setup Tips](./setup/_index.md):
    Tips and tricks for your development tools (only some may be relevant to you)
  - [Bevy Programming](./programming/_index.md):
    overview of programming in Bevy
  - [Bevy Features](./features/_index.md):
    how to use various Bevy game engine features
  - [Common Pitfalls](./pitfalls/_index.md):
    common issues or surprises to watch out for
  - [Advanced Patterns](./patterns/_index.md):
    expert topics; non-obvious tricks or techniques; may be controversial
  - [Bevy Cookbook](./cookbook/_index.md):
    miscellaneous examples for specific common tasks
  - [Bevy on Different Platforms](./platforms/_index.md):
    information about using Bevy with different platforms and OSs

## Stability Warning

Bevy is still a very new and experimental game engine! It has only been
public since August 2020!

While improvements have been happening at an incredible pace, and development
is active, Bevy simply hasn't yet had the time to mature.

*There are no stability guarantees and breaking changes happen often!*

Usually, it not hard to adapt to changes with new releases (or even track
the main git development branch), but you have been warned!
